      <p>Monkeys live in trees, grasslands, mountains, forests, and on high plains. A group of monkeys is called a troop. 
        Most primates share six basic features: forward-facing eyes, eye sockets, grasping hands, nails, fingerprints, and large brains. 
        Monkeys are most easily distinguished from apes by their tails.

      <p>Rhinos are thought to be the second largest land animal, with the elephant being the largest. 
        They have a robust, cylindrical body with a large head, relatively short legs, and short tail. 
        The characteristic feature of these animals is a large horn in the middle of their faces; some species have a second, smaller horn.

      <p>Pigs are mammals with stocky bodies, flat snouts that can move independently of their heads, small eyes and large ears. They are highly intelligent, social animals, and are found all over the world. 
        Pigs are in the Suidae family, which includes eight genera and 16 species.
